<h2 class="centered mb">I am a Ruby on Rails developer with a passion to learn more.</h2>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>Since graduating from Melbourne University with a Bachelor in Computer Information Systems I have been working for my <a href="http://playarcade.co">startup</a>, spending time <a href="https://www.codementor.io/spacepotato">mentoring</a>,
 and learning as much as possible</p>
</div> 
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>Although the majority of experience is as a back-end developer using Ruby on Rails I also have experience in front-end development, in particular with AngularJS and the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic framework</a></p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<br>
<div class="row">
  <h2>Ruby (v1.9+)/Ruby on Rails (v4+)</h2>
  <p>As you will notice the majority of my development experience has been in Ruby or Ruby on Rails. This is due to the fact that almost all of the backend for my startup has been built using it. In particular I have experience with:</p>
  <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>API Design and Implementation</li>
    <li>Multi-tenancy based development</li>
    <li>Proper OO Design (as preached by Metz)</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Ruby is also the language I spend the most time improving on, in particular in the areas of TDD and Metaprogramming
</div>
<br> 
<div class="row">
  <h2>Javascript/AngularJS (v1.4)/Ionic</h2>
  <p>The experience I have in Javascript (and Angular) is very project directed as I honed my skills in them as required for projects. All of the web applications and mobile applications that have been created for my startup have been done using AngularJS (and Ionic for the mobile applications). I have also designed and built an online interactive quiz module for a local seconday college using pure Javascript.</p>
</div> 
<br>
<div class="row">
  <h2>NodeJS</h2>
  <p>As part of a hobby project I used NodeJS, in conjunction with Socket.io, to create the backend for a chat application. The chat application included real time chat, typing notifications, push notifications for offline users and the ability to send images. Since then I have gradually enhanced the project and actually ended up using it for my startup.

  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p>When I am not developing you can usually find me on the basketball court, vegging out in front of TV or hunched over an anvil (and of course the standard one of playing video games). I also quite enjoying playing musical instruments, having played Trumpet and the Bass guitar for a combined 10 years.</p>

  <h1>Want to see more?</h1>

<div class="row">
  <p>As you may have noticed my Github is a little bare. This is due to the fact that almost all of the code I have written over the past two years has been on proprietry projects or on my own startup. If you would like to see some code samples or learn more about me please feel free to contact me.</p>
